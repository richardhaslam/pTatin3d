pTatin3D is a software package designed for studying long time-scale processes
relevant to geodynamics. The original motivation for this development was to
provide the community with an open-source toolkit capable of studying high-resolution,
three-dimensional models of lithospheric deformation.

Unique to this package is that we provide fast, parallel scalable matrix-free 
defintions for the Stokes operators which are utilized by a hybrid 
geometric-algebraic multi-grid preconditioner.

pTatin3D includes the following:
*  mixed finite elemenets (Q2-P1_disc) for the Stokes problem
* material points for tracking Lagrangian state and history variables
* energy equation solved with Q1 elements + SUPG
* ALE formulations (with a varierty of remeshing solutions)
* extensible rheology components (currently supports: iso-viscous, Frank-Kamenetskii, Arrhenius, power-law, von Mises, Drucker Prager)
* full support for spatio-temporal Dirichlet and non-zero Neumann boundary conditions
* extensible coupling with landscape evolution models (curernt support for FastScape)
* full support for Newton and Picard non-linear solvers
* massively parallel implementation

pTatin3D heavily leverages functionality from PETSc [http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc]
