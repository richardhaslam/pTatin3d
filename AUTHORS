 ** 
 **   pTatin3d is a C library designed to solve variable viscosity Stokes 
 **   flow problems in three dimensions. The flow problem is discretised  
 **   using a mixed finite element (FE) formulation (Q2-P1) whilst Lagrangian
 **   state and history variables are discretised with the material-point 
 **   method (MPM). Unique to this FE-MPM package is that we provide fast, 
 **   parallel scalable matrix-free defintions for the Stokes operators which 
 **   are utilized by a hybrid geometric-algebraic multi-grid preconditioner.
